I am a postdoctoral researcher and Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie fellow ([MT-PoINT project](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101027973)) in the [David Gfeller Lab](https://gfellerlab.org/). I develop data-driven methods to model T cell interactions with cancer cells, with the aim of accelerating personalized cancer immunotherapies. 

I obtained my Ph.D. at the [Sorbonne University, Paris](http://www.lcqb.upmc.fr/), supervised by [Martin Weigt](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HU1K_zsAAAAJ). I worked on machine learning and physics-inspired methods for modeling the structure and evolution of proteins from their amino acid sequence. A physicist by training, my academic background includes a BSc from the [University of Pavia](https://web.unipv.it/) and an MSc from the [&#201;cole Normale Sup√©rieure, Paris](https://www.ens.psl.eu/) in theoretical and statistical physics.
