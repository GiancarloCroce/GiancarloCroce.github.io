I am a postdoctoral researcher and Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie fellow ([MT-PoINT project](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101027973)) in the [David Gfeller Lab](https://gfellerlab.org/). My research focuses on developing data-driven models to understand how T cells interact with cancer cells, with the goal of advancing cancer immunotherapy.

I completed my Ph.D. at the [Sorbonne University, Paris](http://www.lcqb.upmc.fr/), under the supervision of [Martin Weigt](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HU1K_zsAAAAJ), where I developed machine learning and physics-inspired approaches to model protein structure and evolution from amino acid sequences. With a background in theoretical and statistical physics, I hold a BSc from the [University of Pavia](https://web.unipv.it/) and an MSc from the [&#201;cole Normale Sup√©rieure, Paris](https://www.ens.psl.eu/).
