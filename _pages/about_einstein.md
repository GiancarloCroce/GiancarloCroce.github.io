I’m currently a postdoctoral researcher & Marie Curie fellow in the [David Gfeller Lab](https://gfellerlab.org/) at the University of Lausanne (Switzerland). My work foucuses on developing data-driven approaches to model and predict the interactions between T cells and cancer epitopes. Accurate predictions can narrow down the list of T cell candidates for personalized cancer immunotherapies, and significantly accelerate cancer immunotherapy clinical developments.

Previously, I completed my PhD within the Martin Weigt Statistical Genomics and Biological Physics Lab at Sorbonne University, Paris in 2019. A fundamental question in computational biology is how to extract the key properties of a protein from its amino acid sequence. By combining tools from machine learning with up-to-date approaches from statistical physics, I developed sequence-based computational tools to model and predict protein structures, interaction networks and evolutionary dynamics. Prior to my PhD, I completed a BSc at the University of Pavia (Italy) and an MSc at the Ecole Normale Supérieure, Paris in theoretical and statistical physics.
